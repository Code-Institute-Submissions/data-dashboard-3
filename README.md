Welcome to Derek Dhammaloka's Milestone Project - Interactive Front
End.  This is about the Data Dashboard.

## UX

The website is for users to give an idea on how much they spend on petrol for
a particular year (e.g. 2018). 

As a user, I want to see how much I spend on petrol for a particular year
(e.g. 2018).  Breakdowns are available and they include by Company, Month, Litres
and Miles.  For example, I could download a PDF File (e.g. petrol-spend-by-company.pdf) to
see how much money I have spent by company.  Data Tables are available.

Wireframes include line charts, bar charts and scatter charts.

## Features

Features include selecting a chart.

Downloading a PDF file, so that it can be printed.  This includes paperless versions such as One Note and XPS (XML Paper Specification).

## Technologies

This project uses JavaScript to access D3, Crossfilter, DC and Queue.

CSS - This project uses external style sheets.

## Testing

When I click on each link, it should go to the correct destination. If it
is a link to a PDF file, it should go to the correct PDF file in a new window,
without leaving the web page.

## Deployment

I will deploy the project to GitHub Pages.
